## This project is the implementation for the Thesis titled: 
# Counterfactual Explanation Generation for Reinforcement Learning
## written by Caitlin Kenney under the co-supervision of Jasmina Gajcin and Ivana Dusparic.
### The goal of this project is to modify  a published counterfactual generation method titled RACCER and apply it to a new environment known as Taxi [1,2]. After which in the paper we will evaluate its accuracy, robustness, and the types of counterfactuals that can be produced.
